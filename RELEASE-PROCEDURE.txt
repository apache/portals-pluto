==========================================
Environment setup for releasing artifacts
==========================================
Since 3.0.0

1. Environmental Setup
	* Increase the default Java heap available to Maven
	* export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx256m -XX:MaxPermSize=128m"
	* Use the JDK 1.8.
	* Use Maven 3.3.1 or higher
	* edit $HOME/.m2/settings.xml, make sure your Apache account credentials are setup in the servers section:
        <servers>
            <server>
              <id>apache.snapshots.https</id>
              <username>your-apache-username</username>
              <password>your-apache-password</password>
            </server>

            <server>
              <id>apache.releases.https</id>
              <username>your-apache-username</username>
              <password>your-apache-password</password>
            </server>
    * submit your public key to an authorized Public Key server such as http://pgp.mit.edu/
      see instructions here:
        http://blog.sonatype.com/2010/01/how-to-generate-pgp-signatures-with-maven/

2. Prepare the source for release
	* Cleanup JIRA so the Fix Version in issues resolved since the last release includes this release version correctly.
	* Create a JIRA issue for release maintenance for example see
		https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PLUTO-777
	* Checkout a clean copy of the trunk (on the specific branch if needed) to release using command line git.
	    cd ~/apache/releases
	    git clone https://github.com/apache/portals-pluto

	* Do not use Eclipse to do the checkout. The extra dot (.) files created by Eclipse throws off the rat:check processing.

3. Verify the source has the required license headers before trying to release.

    mvn -P rat apache-rat:check

4. DRY RUN
	Do a dry run of the release:prepare step:

		$ mvn -P apache-release -DrunOnlyAtExecutionRoot=true release:prepare -DdryRun=true

	The dry run will not commit any changes back to Git and gives you the opportunity to verify that the release process will complete as expected.
	You will be prompted for the following information :

		Release version - take the default or use semvar like 3.0.1
		SCM release tag - review the default naming and compare it with the existing git tag structure; change it if needed.
		New development version - take the default
		Have your GPG Passphrase ready

	If you cancel a release:prepare before it updates the pom.xml versions, then use the release:clean goal to just remove the extra files that were created.
	The Maven release plugin checks for SNAPSHOT dependencies in pom's. It will not complete the prepare goal until all SNAPSHOT dependencies are resolved.

5. VERIFY RELEASE
	Verify that the release process completed as expected

	The release plugin will create pom.xml.tag files which contain the changes that would have been committed to Git.
	The only differences between pom.xml.tag and it's corresponding pom.xml file should be the version number(s) and git location(s) (e.g., /trunk vs /tags).

	Check release.properties and make sure that the scm properties have the right version. Sometimes the scm location can be the previous version not the next version.

	Verify signatures (Verifying release signatures)
        gpg --verify target/pluto-3.0.1-SNAPSHOT-source-release.zip.asc target/pluto-3.0.1-SNAPSHOT-source-release.zip

6. CLEANUP AND START OVER
	Cleanup the release prepare files again:

	$ mvn -P all,apache-release release:clean

7. PREPARE THE RELEASE
	Run the "release:prepare" step for real this time. You'll be prompted for the same version information.

	$ mvn -P all,apache-release -DrunOnlyAtExecutionRoot=true release:prepare

	Backup (zip or tar) your local release candidate directory in case you need to rollback the release after the next step is performed.

8. PERFORM THE RELEASE
	a. This step will create a maven staging repository and site for use in testing and voting.

	$ mvn -P all,apache-release release:perform -Duser.name=[your_apache_uid]

	If your local OS userid doesn't match your Apache userid, then you'll have to also override the value provided
	by the OS to Maven for the site-deploy step to work. This is known to work for Linux, but not for Mac and unknown for Windows.

	b. Release Archetypes (OPTIONAL)

	$ cd maven-archetypes/bean-portlet-archetype
	$ mvn -P apache-release release:prepare
	$ mvn -P apache-release release:perform

	$ cd maven-archetypes/generic-portlet-archetype
	$ mvn -P apache-release release:prepare
	$ mvn -P apache-release release:perform

9. VERIFY THE RELEASE
	a. Verify signatures (Verifying release signatures)

	$ gpg --verify target/pluto-3.0.1-source-release.zip.asc target/pluto-3.0.1-source-release.zip

    b. Verify the Nexus release artifacts

    Verify the staged artifacts in the nexus repo
        https://repository.apache.org/index.html
    Staging repositories (under Build Promotion) --> Name column --> org.apache.portals-XXX
    Navigate through the artifact tree and make sure that all javadoc, sources, tests, jars, ... have
        .asc (GPG signature)
        .md5 files
    See http://people.apache.org/~henkp/repo/faq.html and http://www.apache.org/dev/release-signing.html#openpgp-ascii-detach-sig

10. Checkout the new tag, since the repository will be set to a later commit

        git checkout pluto-3.0.1

11. Create a Distribution Bundle
        
        ant -f dist-build.xml -DincludeDemos=true -DpackageOnly=true -DnoClean=true

12. Release the bundle Zip file

	a. Use Maven command-line to release pluto-3.0.1-bundle.zip

        #
        # NOTE: This will release a file with the following identification:
        #		 <groupId>org.apache.portals.pluto</groupId>
        #		 <artifactId>pluto-bundle</artifactId>
        #		 <version>3.0.1</version>
        #
        #  And the download filename will be pluto-bundle-3.0.1.zip
        #
        mvn \
          gpg:sign-and-deploy-file \
          -Dfile=target/dist/pluto-3.0.1-bundle.zip \
          -DgroupId=org.apache.portals.pluto \
          -DartifactId=pluto-bundle \
          -Dversion=3.0.1 \
          -Durl=https://repository.apache.org/service/local/staging/deploy/maven2 \
          -DrepositoryId=apache.releases.https

    b. Close the nexus staging repo

        https://repository.apache.org/index.html
        Staging repositories (under Build Promotion) --> Name column --> org.apache.portals-XXX
        Click checkbox for the open staging repo (org.apache.portals-XXX) and press Close in the menu bar.

    c. Create a temporary directory for working with Apache's Subversion repository (svnpubsub) for release artifacts:

        $ mkdir ~/asf-svn
        $ cd ~/asf-svn

    d. Checkout the "dev" folder for Apache Pluto:

        $ mkdir dev
        $ cd dev
        $ svn co https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/portals/pluto
        $ cd pluto

    e. Edit and then execute the following script in order to download the release artifacts from Nexus and
       commit them to Subversion:

    #!/bin/sh
    #
    # NOTE: SET USER NAME TO YOUR APACHE ID
    #
    USER_NAME=asfgriff
    #
    # NOTE: SET BASE URL TO THE NEXUS STAGING REPOSITORY
    #

    svn commit -m "PLUTO-716 Committing Binary Release for Pluto 3.0.1" --username $USER_NAME

13. PUT THE RELEASE CANDIDATE UP FOR A VOTE

    a. Create a VOTE email thread on dev@ to record votes as replies. (See Example VOTE e-mail message)
    b. Perform a review of the release and cast your vote. See the following for more details on Apache releases

        http://www.apache.org/dev/release.html

    c. A -1 vote does not necessarily mean that the vote must be redone, however it is usually a good idea to rollback the release if a -1 vote is received.
    If you want to recover it from a vetoed release, refer to the OpenJPA documentation, Recovering from a vetoed release.

    d. After the vote has been open for at least 72 hours, has at least three +1 PMC votes and no -1 votes, then post the results to the vote thread by
       reply to the initial email and prepend to the original subject "[RESULT]" (See Example RESULT e-mail message)
       Include a list of everyone who voted +1, 0 or -1.

       References:
            Apache Voting Process http://www.apache.org/foundation/voting.html
            Who We Are (Apache Portals Project) http://portals.apache.org/whoweare.html

14. FINALIZE THE RELEASE

    a. Promote the staged nexus artifacts
        https://repository.apache.org/index.html
        Staging repositories (under Build Promotion) --> Name column --> org.apache.portals
        Click checkbox of the closed staging repo (org.apache.portals-XXX) and select Release.

    b. Move the source/binary artifacts over to the distribution area
       Command line examples to distribute artifacts (pluto-3.0.1-source-release.zip as an example below.):

        $ cd ~/asf/svn
        $ mkdir release
        $ cd release
        $ svn co https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/portals/pluto
        $ cd pluto
        $ mv ../../dev/portals/pluto/pluto-3.0.1-source-release* .
        $ svn add pluto-3.0.1-source-release*
        $ svn commit -m "PLUTO-716 Committing Source Release for pluto-3.0.1" --username $USER_NAME
        $ mv ../../dev/portals/pluto/portlet-api-3.0.1* .
        $ svn add portlet-api-3.0.1*
        $ svn commit -m "PLUTO-716 Committing Binary Release for pluto-3.0.1" --username $USER_NAME
        $ mv ../../dev/portals/pluto/pluto-bundle-3.0.1.zip* .
        $ svn add pluto-bundle-3.0.1.zip*
        $ svn commit -m "PLUTO-716 Committing Binary Release for Pluto 3.0.1" --username $USER_NAME
        $ cd ../dev/pluto
        $ FILES=`svn status | grep pluto | awk '{print $2}'`
        $ svn rm $FILES
        $ svn commit -m "PLUTO-716 Promoted artifacts from dev to release for Pluto 3.0.1" --username $USER_NAME

    WAIT 24hrs after committing releases for mirrors to replicate before announcing release

15. UPDATE JIRA
    Update the JIRA versions page to close all issues, mark the version as "released", and set the date to the date
    that the release was approved. You may also need to make a new release entry for the next release.

    Generate the Release Notes from the Version page

16. UPDATE SITE DOCS

    a. Copy the previous xdoc version folder to a new one which matches the release version, for example:
        $ cd ~/asf/svn
        $ svn checkout https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/portals/site/
        $ cp -r pluto/src/site/xdoc/v30 pluto/src/site/xdoc/v301

    b. Edit the following files, replacing "v30" with "v301" and "3.0.0" with "3.0.1":
        pluto/src/site/xdoc/v301/*
        pluto/src/site/fml/faq.fml
        pluto/src/site/site.xml
        pluto/src/site/xdoc/download.xml
        pluto/src/site/xdoc/index.xml
        pluto/src/site/xdoc/news.xml
        src/site/xdoc/news.xml

    c. Edit site/pluto/src/site/xdoc/v30/release-notes.xml
        include generated release notes from step 15

    d. Generate the site:
        $ cd ~/asf/svn/site
        $ mvn site
        $ cd pluto
        $ mvn site

    e. Publish the docs to LIVE SITE

    Commit changes into the SVN location of Apache Portals Maven Site documentation:
        https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/portals/site/

    Copy the generated html and resources into the workspace folder of the following svnpubsub SVN location:
        https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/portals/site-live/
    Commit your changes to site-live, they will publish automatically

17. ANNOUNCE THE RELEASE

    Make an announcement about the release on the

        general@portals.apache.org
        pluto-user@portals.apache.org

        announce@apache.org list

        as per the Apache Announcement Mailing Lists page) (See Example ANNOUNCE e-mail message)
        NOTE: Because announce@apache.org list allows message posting only to senders having '@apache.org' e-mail address.
        Therefore, be sure that you send the announce message by your apache e-mail address.
        See Committer e-mail configuration for detail.
        NOTE: When sending announce message to multiple lists together from your @apache.org e-mail address,
        be careful because your message can be rejected if your @apache.org e-mail address didn't susbscribe user mailinglist
         (portalapps-user@portals.apache.org, in this case.) You can either subscribe it first from your @apache.org
         e-mail address or send the announce message twice separately.

        NOTE: It is not required but it is better to digitally sign the announce e-mail message by using your PGP key.

                - go to G-mail settings page
                - Select 'Accounts and Import' tab
                - In 'Send mail as' field,
                 - click on 'Add another email address you own'
                 - type your name and apache e-mail address in the popup
                 - enter 'mail-relay.apache.org' in SMTP Server field and choose 465 as port number
                 - enter your apache account username and password
                 - select 'Secured connection using SSL (recommended)' (default)
                 - click on 'Add Account'
                 - ...
                - You can change the default send email address if want there.
                - When sending e-mail, check the sender address is @apache.org.
