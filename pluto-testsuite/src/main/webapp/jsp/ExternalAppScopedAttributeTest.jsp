            This test is to validate that application scoped attributes can be
            viewed by resources outside of the portlet. Additionally, it tests
            to make sure that session attributes set by other resources may be
            viewed by the portlet as an application scoped session attribute.
          </p>

            This test requires manual intervention. Click
