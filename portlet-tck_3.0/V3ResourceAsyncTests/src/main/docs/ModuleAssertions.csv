// The tool is used with the command: java -jar TestFileGenerator.jar <filespec>
// Example:                           java -jar target\TestFileGenerator.jar ModuleAssertions.csv
//
// The format of this file is as follows:
// * lines beginning with '//', blank lines, and the header line beginning with
//   'Class / Section' are ignored.
// * If the first line begins with 'PARMS', the rest of the line contains parameters for the run.
//   The output path can be specified as parameter.
// * A line containing a single word followed by ';;;;' starts a new module.
// * The tool can generate multiple modules from one input file.
// * The class name is generated from the module name and the contents of the first and 
//   second columns. When this combination changes, you get a new portlet.
//
// The tool recognizes duplicate test case names. You should make sure that there are none.
