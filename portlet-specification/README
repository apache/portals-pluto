
Readme for the Portlet Specification:
=====================================

The portlet specification version 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 were created within the
framework of the Java Community Process, see:

https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=168
https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=286
https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=362

The Portlet Specification is closely tied to the Servlet Specification and other
Java Enterprise Edition technology. Since the Enterprise Edition specifications
have been transferred to the Eclipse Jakarta project (see links below), it would
make sense for the Portlet Specification to move to Eclipse Jakarta as well.

As an interim step, the source corresponding to Portlet Specification Version 3.0
is being placed here, since this repository also hosts the Reference Implementation,
Portlet API class files, and the Technology Compliance Kit for version 3.0.

This directory contains the complete portlet specification source in Microsoft
Word document format along with the illustrations from the spec as separate image 
files, which are generally in 'gif' format.

Most of the illustrations were created using Microsoft Powerpoint. The PowerPoint
source file is also provided.

Note that the official version of the current v3.0 specification can be obtained from
the jcp.org download page, located here:

Files:

aPortletSpec.docx    - The specification document
SpecPics.pptx        - Powerpoint file containing many of the illustrations

The remaining files are image files from the illustrations that were imported 
into the spec.
